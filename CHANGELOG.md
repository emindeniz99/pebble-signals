# Changelog

All notable changes to signal-piu. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
each release carries an **Upgrading** subsection — the scaffold files a project
OWNS (wscript, src/c, tsconfigs, manifest — see docs/packaging.md "Upgrades")
are never auto-touched, so any change they need is listed there explicitly.
No registry releases yet; entries accumulate under Unreleased until the first
`npm publish`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `createResource(fetcher)` async primitive; typed `ByteStore`; generic public
  API (`signal<T>`, `ReadonlySignal<T>`, flow prop contracts).
- Per-app **export pruning** (`--no-prune` to disable) — unused runtime exports
  are dropped from the shipped mod (clock: 15613 → 9988 bytes, boots again).
- `create-signal-piu` scaffold CLI; compiled `dist/` for consumers
  (`dist/build.mjs`); `npm run dev` (build+install+logs, `--watch`).
- `npm run test:xs` — conformance laws on the real XS engine.
- Examples: consumer (npm-package proof), watchface, worker, migration
  (before/after), navreactive, navmany.

### Changed
- **JSXNode type split** (was `Node = any`): children/build thunks are typed
  `Content | string | number | boolean | null | undefined | JSXNode[]`.
  *Upgrading:* code that passed arbitrary placeholder objects as children now
  fails typecheck (it was never renderable at runtime); return real elements
  or primitives.
- Consumers run `node_modules/signal-piu/dist/build.mjs` (NOT `build.mts` —
  Node refuses type-stripping under node_modules).

### Fixed
- #29 boot regression (arena floor vs runtime size) via export pruning;
  the "swapped-screen reactive crash" was the same pressure — overturned.
